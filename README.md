#### Installation:
Following libraries were installed for creating a Word cloud:
1.	pip install wordcloud
2.	pip install pillow
3. pip install sklearn
4. pip install pandas
4. pip install numpy

#### Project Motivation:
For this project, I was interested in exploring the Airbnb Boston data to better understand:
1.	The type of properties listed in Boston on Airbnb
2.	How has the demand changed for Airbnb accommodations over time?
3.	Is there any seasonality in the demand of the Airbnb rentals?
4.	How do the prices of the listings fluctuate over various months?
5.	What factors influence the pricing of an accommodation?
6.	What are the most important factors for a customer while renting an Airbnb?


#### File Descriptions: 
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Headings and markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

#### Results:
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here: https://medium.com/@kritigarg_66337/airbnbs-boston-market-assessing-the-demand-and-supply-62c92c023fb0.
