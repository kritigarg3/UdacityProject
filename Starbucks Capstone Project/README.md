## **Installation**

The files in this repository run on an anaconda installed Python environment. Installed scikit-learn==0.20 for model evaluation.

## **Project Motivation**

For this project, the motivation was to develop a predictive supervised model which can identify whether a Starbucks customer will complete a promotional offer he received after viewing or not. I also did some exploratory analysis on the data.

**profile.json:** : Rewards program users

**portfolio.json:** Offers sent during 30-day test period
